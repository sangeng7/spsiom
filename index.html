                <h2>Welcome To Our Site</h2>
                <p>I am Ben Carling, the owner and head coach at Sports Performance Services Ltd, based in Douglas, Isle
                    of
                    Man. After studying business management, I decided embark in a career that was also a passion of
                    mine;
                    health and fitness. I had played sports from an early age so it seemed a natural thing to do. I
                    became a
                    qualified Personal Trainer, and latterly an accredited Strength and Conditioning coach with the
                    UKSCA.
                    Currently there are only 4 accredited coaches in the Isle of Man, and circa 600 in the UK.</p><br>
                <p> \As well as private work, I work at the Isle of Man Sport Institute. I work with a wide cross
                    section of
                    athletes from different sports, from field based sports such as football, rugby and hockey to
                    individual
                    sports such as archery, sailing, tennis, motorsport and swimming. I am proud to have played my part
                    in
                    helping these athletes set personal bests, Island records and some that have gone on to achieve
                    scholarships or youth contracts at professional level.</p><br>
